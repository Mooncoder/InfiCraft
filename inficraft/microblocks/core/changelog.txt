52.2.0:
* Refactored microblock API.
* Improved handling of invalid microblock IDs.
* Allowed microblock IDs over 32767 by storing them in NBT. Old ones will not stack with new ones unless you place and break them.

52.1.0:
* Included some microblock fixes, and an experimental mod framework used by InfiniTubes.

52.0.5:
* Recompiled with Java 6.

52.0.4:
* Re-added missing registration of microblock tile entity. Existing placed microblocks will disappear. Sorry :( 

52.0.3:
* Fixed packaging again.

52.0.2:
* Fixed mcmod.info

52.0.1:
* Fixed packaging.

52.0.0:
* Updated to 1.4.6.
* For FML's ID mismatch detection, all blocks registered by my mods will count as being registered by Immibis Core,
  instead of sometimes Immibis Core and sometimes the actual mod. This may result in ID mismatch warnings the first
  time you load an old world, which can be safely ignored.
* API rearrangements.
* Blocks and items now use consistent default IDs based on the hashcode of their name. Before this, all blocks
  had the same default ID, which was pretty pointless as all but the first would get autoassigned.
  This might need to be changed again if it causes too many conflicts.

51.0.6:
* Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException caused by breaking the same part twice (caused by lag).
* Internal changes to microblock API.
* Added chiseled sandstone, smooth sandstone and redstone lamp microblocks.

51.0.5:
* Fixed microblocks not being placeable.
* "Microblock container" blocks with no microblocks in them will now destroy themselves.

51.0.4:
* Started changelog.
* Now splits packets bigger than 32kiB and reassembles them on the other end. (fixes Immibis's Peripherals speakers in SMP)
* Fixed an ID allocation typo which made it easier for conflicts to happen when adding new mods.
